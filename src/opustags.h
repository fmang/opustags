/**
 * \file src/opustags.h
 *
 * Welcome to opustags!
 *
 * Let's have a quick tour around. The project is split into the following modules:
 *
 * - The system module provides a few generic tools for interating with the system.
 * - The ogg module reads and writes Ogg files, letting you manipulate Ogg pages and packets.
 * - The opus module parses the contents of Ogg packets according to the Opus specifications.
 * - The cli module implements the main logic of the program.
 * - The opustags module contains the main function, which is a simple wrapper around cli.
 *
 * Each module is implemented in its eponymous .cc file. Their interfaces are all defined and
 * documented together in this header file. Look into the .cc files for implementation-specific
 * details.
 *
 * To understand how this program works, you need to know what an Ogg files is made of, in
 * particular the streams, pages, and packets. You hardly need any knowledge of the actual Opus
 * audio codec, but need the RFC 7845 "Ogg Encapsulation for the Opus Audio Codec" that defines the
 * format of the header packets that are essential to opustags.
